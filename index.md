## {{page.title}}

Welcome to the homepage for the GA4GH SchemaBlocks project. 

SchemaBlocks represents a cross work stream, cross driver project attempt to document object standards and prototypes, as well as common data formats and semantics. While products and implementation may be completely based on SchemaBlocks models, this project does not attempt to develop a rigid, complete schema but rather to provide the object vocabulary and semantics for a large range of developments.

The SchemaBlocks site can be accessed though the permanent link [schemablocks.org](http://schemablocks.org).
